# Performance-and-Financial-Indicators

This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key performance and financial indicators for a business firm.  It leverages ratio analysis, a powerful tool for assessing the financial health and stability of a company, to uncover meaningful insights from the underlying data.  By visualizing these ratios and indicators, the dashboard facilitates the identification of trends, patterns, and potential areas of concern or opportunity.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of what this description implies:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):  These are specific, measurable values that demonstrate how effectively a company is achieving its business objectives.  Examples might include sales growth, Profitability etc.,.  The dashboard presents these KPIs in a clear and concise manner, allowing users to quickly grasp the company's performance in critical areas.

Ratio Analysis: This is a crucial component of the dashboard.  Ratio analysis involves comparing different line items from the financial statements to create ratios that provide a deeper understanding of the company's performance.  These ratios normalize the data, allowing for comparisons across different time periods and even against competitors.  Examples include:

Profitability Ratios: (e.g.,Net Profit Margin) - These show how effectively a company generates profit.
Liquidity Ratios: (e.g., Current Ratio) - These assess the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.
Solvency Ratios: (e.g., Gearing Ratio) - These indicate the company's long-term financial stability and its ability to meet its long-term obligations.
Efficiency Ratios: (e.g., Inventory Turnover, Accounts Receivable Turnover) - These measure how efficiently a company manages its assets.
